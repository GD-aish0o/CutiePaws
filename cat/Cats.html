                <p>Cats are fascinating creatures known for their independent yet affectionate nature. Their playful antics and soothing purrs make them beloved companions. Cats form strong bonds with humans, providing emotional support and reducing stress. Interacting with cats can increase levels of oxytocin, the “love hormone,” enhancing feelings of happiness and bonding. Studies have shown that having a cat can alleviate symptoms of anxiety and depression, promoting overall mental well-being2. Whether you’re a cat owner or an admirer, these furry friends bring joy and comfort to our lives.</p>
